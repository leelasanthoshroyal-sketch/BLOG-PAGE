                <p>allows computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves feeding data into algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions on new data. It is used in various applications like image recognition, speech processing, language translation, recommender systems, etc. In this article, we will see more about ML and its core concepts.</p>

                    Machine Learning is a subdomain of artificial intelligence. It allows computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed, and It is designed in such a way that allows systems to identify patterns, make predictions, and make decisions based on data.

                    Feature Engineering is the process of selecting, creating or modifying features like input variables or data to help machine learning models learn patterns more effectively. It involves transforming raw data into meaningful inputs that improve model accuracy and performance.

                        Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns from labelled data—meaning every input has a corresponding correct output. The model makes predictions and compares them with the true outputs, adjusting itself to reduce errors and improve accuracy over time. The goal is to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. For example, a model trained on images of handwritten digits can recognise new digits it has never seen before.

                <p>
                   Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that analyzes and models data without labelled responses or predefined categories. Unlike supervised learning, where the algorithm learns from input-output pairs, unsupervised learning algorithms work solely with input data and aim to discover hidden patterns, structures or relationships within the dataset independently, without any human intervention or prior knowledge of the data's meaning.

                    Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.
